Step 1: Bring up the 3 FRR routers                                                                                                                                                                                
  cd lab/frr-testbed                                                                                                                                                                                                
  docker compose up -d                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Step 2: Wait ~15 seconds for OSPF/iBGP to converge, then verify                                                                                                                                                   
  sudo bash scripts/verify.sh                                                                                                                                                                                       
  You should see OSPF Full adjacencies and BGP peers between the three routers.                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Step 3: Create the GRE tunnel from your host into Edge1                                                                                                                                                           
  sudo bash scripts/setup-gre.sh                                                                                                                                                                                    
  This does 4 things:                                                                                                                                                                                               
  1. Assigns 10.0.100.100 to the Docker peering bridge on your host                                                                                                                                                 
  2. Creates gre-netclaw tunnel on your host (local 10.0.100.100, remote 10.0.100.1)                                                                                                                                
  3. Creates the matching gre-netclaw tunnel inside the Edge1 container                                                                                                                                             
  4. Adds static routes so your host can reach the internal lab networks (10.0.12.0/24, 10.0.23.0/24) via GRE                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Step 4: Test GRE reachability                                                                                                                                                                                     
  ping 172.16.0.1      # Edge1 tunnel endpoint                                                                                                                                                                      
  ping 1.1.1.1         # Edge1 loopback via GRE                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Step 5: Run install.sh (in your new tab)                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  When the installer reaches Step 41 (Protocol MCP), it installs the scapy/networkx/fastmcp dependencies for the protocol speakers.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  At Step 42 (Protocol Peering Wizard), it will ask:                                                                                                                                                                
  Enable protocol participation?

  Say y, and accept the defaults:

  Your Steps (You're Person A — first mover)                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Step 1 — Your .env is already set. FRR lab is running. No re-install needed.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Step 2 — Start ngrok on port 1179 (not 179 — that's privileged):                                                                                                                                                  
  ngrok tcp 1179                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  This will give you an endpoint like 0.tcp.ngrok.io:XXXXX. Write that down — that's what Person B needs.                                                                                                           

tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:14027                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  Step 3 — Start openclaw gateway as normal. When the BGP daemon starts, it will:

  - Listen on 0.0.0.0:1179 for inbound mesh connections (ngrok forwards here)
